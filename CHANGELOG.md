# Changelog for `weierstrass-functions`

## 0.1.6.0 - 2023-10-19

- Increased the lower bound of the version of the 'jacobi-theta' dependency.

- Now the Weierstrass functions are defined from the half-periods rather than 
from the elliptic invariants. Each of them has a "prime" version defined from 
the elliptic invariants: `weierstrassP` and `weierstrassP'`, etc.


## 0.1.5.0 - 2023-10-18

Increased the lower bound of the version of the 'jacobi-theta' dependency, 
in order to use the new function `jtheta1Dash0`.

Increased the lower bound of the version of the 'jacobi-theta' dependency.
